Max item limit -- use this + available memory to determine #records
Avoid iterating over empty bins for touchall?

Key tagging (from MemC3):
  - https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dga/papers/memc3-nsdi2013.pdf
  - With each cval, store one byte of the hash of the key ("tag")
  - On read, first scan tags only (no indirect pointer lookup, cheap compare)
  - Only for matching tags do key check

LRU cache eviction using CLOCK (from MemC3):
  - Keep 1 bit per cval
  - Set to 1 on read
  - On evict, look at ith element:
     - if bit is 0, evict i
       - BE CAREFUL ABOUT CONCURRENT READS!
     - if bit is 1, set to 0, move to i+1

Benchmarks:
  - What is the performance as occupancy increases?
  - Facebook-inspired numbers:
    - http://www.ece.eng.wayne.edu/~sjiang/pubs/papers/atikoglu12-memcached.pdf
    - Use proper read:write ratio (Facebook reports >30:1, sometimes 500:1)
    - Use proper sizes (Facebook reports ~32b keys, ~100s of bytes values)
    - Hit rate 95%
    - 90% of keys occur in 10% of requests: Figure 5
      - 10% of keys in 90% of requests?
    - Key size distribution: GEV dist u = 30.7984, sig = 8.20449, k = 0.078688
      Value size distribution: RP dist Î¸ = 0, sig = 214.476, k = 0.348238
  - Use proper key contention!

UDP protocol needs to be implemented

Should key slice be copied (not aliased) on append/prepend to avoid keeping
body+extra around?
